- name: Define
  steps:
    - Product vision is defined and aligns to a strategic imperative
    - Identified and documented who the primary users are and what their needs are through primary research
    - Identified and documented all service, system, data, and human dependencies, including those that can be deprecated post deployment
    - Defined using OpenAPI Specification and JSON Schema
    - Team behind the service is defined
    - Established a base set of design practices and standards (e.g., versioning, media types, status codes)
    - Defined entire lifespan of the API, including deprecation, even if generalized
- name: Prototype
  steps:
    - Translated API definition into a functioning, virtualized, URL-accessible API that uses synthetic, production-like data as part of the request and responses (test environment)
    - Tested with real consumers in the test environment
    - Provided a list of functional assertions for turning into tests
- name: Iterate
  steps:
    - Built iteratively, driven by ongoing feedback from real consumers
    - Tested performance against expected load and potential stress conditions
    - Conducted security tests and resolved vulnerabilities
    - Documentation is provided within a portal
    - Developed an outreach plan for driving and measuring adoption
    - Identified measurable performance metrics and documented baseline (if one exists) for future comparison
    - Validated correct business and operational metrics are being collected, using automated tools wherever possible
- name: Deploy
  steps:
    - Passed all unit, integration, code quality, performance, and security tests
    - Ensured compliance with all VA privacy and security policies
    - Obtained sign-off from all key stakeholders, including consumers
    - Registered with the API management platform
    - Launched into production environment and usage monitored to ensure any errors are quickly remediated
    - Executed launch outreach plan
- name: Operations
  steps:
    - Retired any previous legacy services that need to be deprecated
    - Achieving business and operational performance targets
    - Developing and deploying product improvements iteratively, driven by ongoing consumer feedback and analysis of product usage
